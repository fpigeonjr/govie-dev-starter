# Google Analytics (GA) Getting Started

* Create a Google Account with your .mil email address
    * [Create Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail)
* Create or sign in to your Analytics account
    * [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
* [Set up a property in your Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508). A property represents your website or app, and is the collection point in Analytics for the data from your site or app.
* **Optional** [Set up a reporting view in your property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009714). Views let you create filtered perspectives of your data; for example, all data except from your companyâ€™s internal IP addresses, or all data associated with a specific sales region.
* Follow the instructions to add the tracking code to your [website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080) or mobile app so you can collect data in you Analytics property.

* To gain access to the DAP(Digital Analytics Program) email [dap@support.digitalgov.gov](dap@support.digitalgov.gov).

You can have new users send requests to this address individually and we will walk them through registration. We have a top-level DOD POC who will approve. As long as they have .mil email addresses, we have a blanket approval from the POC.
